script to download either video or audio of a youtube video


`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Update 4/4/2021:
-Changed how bot gets youtube stream for download
-Now downloads videos with the audio
-Makes .mp3 file for audio only

Used to rely on youtube videos having certain streams, then
would either download video with no audio, or audio as .mp4.
Now it downloads the highest quality stream with video and 
audio, and audio only is converted from .mp4 to .mp3.
